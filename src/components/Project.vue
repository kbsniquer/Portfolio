            <h2>Biltmore Companion Site</h2>
            <p class="pt-4">
              In this project, we were to create a fictional companion website for
              the Biltmore Estate visitors. I created a series of webpages for the
              estate winery, where visitors could access a menu of wines and place
              orders to go while at the winery. The website is meant to naturally
              blend in with the actual Biltmore Estate website, linking back to
              the actual website.
